# Monkey Programming Language

Welcome to the Monkey programming language! This project is an implementation based on the concepts taught in the books [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. 

## About Monkey

Monkey is a dynamically typed programming language designed to be implemented by readers of the books. There is no "official" implementation of Monkey; 

### Example Code

```js
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;

let add = fn(x, y) {
    x + y;
};
let result = add(five, ten);

if (5 < 10) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```
